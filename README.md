This is my personal website, which mainly is a blog. It's running on Wordpress.

Wordpress? You're not a real programmer!
----------------------------------------
Yeah, yeah. Wordpress isn't all that interesting. But then again, solving the problem of blogging isn't very
intresting either. So I abandoned my home-made Rails blogging engine for this, so that I could spend time on stuff that matters.

What's the licence?
-------------------
Since this is Wordpress code, and Wordpress is released under GPLv2, this repository is also released under GPLv2. See [license.txt](https://github.com/evjan/peterevjan.com/blob/master/license.txt) for more info.
