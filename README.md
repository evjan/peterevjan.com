This is my personal website, which mainly is a blog. It's running on Wordpress.

Wordpress?
==========
Yeah, I know. Wordpress isn't all that interesting. But then again, solving the problem of blogging isn't very
intresting either. So I abandoned my home-made Rails blogging engine for this, so that I could spend time on stuff
that matters.
